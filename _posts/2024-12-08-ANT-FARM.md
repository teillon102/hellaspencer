  I always thought ant farms were so cool when I was a kid. Getting to watch them crawl around and dig out their tunnels. I never got to have an ant farm but now I could have a virtual one with a unique never thought
  of before coding project. The birds eye design scheme will involve two "viewports", the first being verticle and showing the ants underground in their tunnels, in profile. The second will be top down, above ground, and will
  display the ants above ground as they collect food. I will elaborate on my design plans more.
